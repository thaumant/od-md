General improvements:
    - Setup a monorepo (yarn workspaces) or monolythic (single tsconfig) configuration.
    - Reuse common types/interfaces between client and server.
    - Create "scripts" folder, move seed.ts there from "server" folder.
    - Setup a linter to improve code style consistency.
    - Add an error popup to the UI in case of a GQL error.
    - Add reset.css.


Concrete improvements:
    - Add async error handling for main() and seed().
    - Add graceful shutdown sequence for the Apollo server.
    - Replace console.log with a logging tool.
    - Add a linter rule that forbids "any" (right now there is a type error in seeds.ts).
    - Add a linter rule that forbids "await" with plain values (right now there is a bug in seeds.ts).
    - Add a linter rule that enforces "key" prop (right now there is an error in UserList.tsx).


Challenge feedback:
    - In readme: describe the toy project in a few words so candidates first see what it is about before diving into how it is implemented.
    - In readme: replace "yarn run <script>" with "yarn <script>".
    - Fix the bugs, unles they are intensional:
        - Fix invalid return type for connectDatabase() in db/index.ts.
        - Fix invalid async loop in seed.ts.
        - Fix missing key prop in UserList.
